# Luzifer / remoteclip

RemoteClip is a very small application to be running on a machine able to manipulate the clipboard of said machine through an HTTP API. This can be used for example to inject text into the clipboard while being in a fullscreen application / game and not being able to copy stuff on the machine directly.
